A personal MERN stack project that I've built for entirely personal uses.

It requires authentication to log in, and only the admin (who happens to be me) can log in to the app as of now.

It helps me create new logs every day to track my weight, compare today's weight to that of yesterday's to show the daily change, see a visualization of my logs (Charts.js), and go through all of my past logs via navigation.
